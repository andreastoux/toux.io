    title: "Currently, my focus is targeted towards anything web development. Until now, I have mostly worked on the Frontend, but I am trying to branch out into full-stack. Besides development, I also do UI/UX design.",
    description: "Amongst the things I’ve had the time & luxury to play around with, I fell the most in love with TypeScript, Firebase, React and its ecosystem, Styled Components, SCSS and two Headless Content Management Systems. I guess I could put that into the JAMStack category. I am also using Figma and Adobe Photoshop on the regular."

    title: "I am interested what the future of the web will be, therefore I’m keen to explore new technologies as I progress, one at a time. Will it be Web Assembly? Will it be WASM & Rust ? !Artificial Intelligence?! Who knows!",
    description: "Whilst teaching myself web development, I’d lie if I said there haven’t been moments where I just wanted to jump and learn a completely new thing, but you see... I got an entire life ahead of me to learn all of that, so all I need is patience. Some of the things that I am interested in and plan on checking out in the future, besides web & application development, are Cybersecurity & Cloud Computing."

    p1: "I've been producing music for over 5 years now. In addition to working on my musical ideas, around the same time, I’ve started dabbling into graphical design. Thus far, I am using Figma, Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop and a bit of Illustrator, because I really want to learn how to design logos and work with vectors for User Interfaces, amongst other things.",
    p2: "I've publicly released around 10 songs/remixes and I am currently planning on making an EP in the future. There are only 24 hours in a day and honestly, there are a lot of things I want to do and it is overwhelming at times, but we’ll get there.",
    p3: "Outside of work my passions include landscaping, hiking and travelling, photography, cooking, music production, DIY projects, binge-watching TV Series, health & wellbeing... and occasionally video-games.",
    p4: "I care a lot about people and value honesty, integrity, kindness, empathy, transparency, vulnerability, and trust more than anything. Treat me good & I’ll treat you better, treat me bad & I’ll treat you worse. I consider myself an empath and a perfectionist, I want to build things and help others at the same time. So, why not build things that help others?"
